## Introduction

This AWS CDK Tutorials repository serves as a learning resource for developers, DevOps engineers, and anyone interested in building infrastructure on AWS using the AWS CDK. Each example project is broken down into steps and has a linked blog post (in some cases a YouTube video as well) that show you everything you need to know about that project.

## Requirements

Before you follow along with one of the example projects, it's a good idea to get the following technologies setup and configured.

- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

## Getting Started

1. Find an example project you want to follow along with.
2. Read the linked blog post/watch the YouTube video.
3. Follow along with the code.
4. Integrate it into your own projects! ðŸš€
